1. **Contract**: make sure the code follows our convention, ex: naming, explicit returns, etc.; if uncertain, discuss with others

2. **Test**: make sure tests can cover most normal and edge cases; if not, open follow-up tickets. Also, look out for failed tests and fix them!

3. **CHANGELOG.md**: update when external interfaces are changed

4. Workflow: 
    - Github: assign the pr to yourself; if pairing, can merge directly; else, assign someone to help review
    - Asana: assign the corresponding ticket to yourself and leave the pr link on it for easier follow-ups
    - Discord: if someone is mentioned in this pr, tag on Discord
